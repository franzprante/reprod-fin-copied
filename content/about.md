Welcome to Reproducible Finance.

What is RF? Why are we here?.

In addition to posts written by the RStudio team, we hope that R Views will attract other voices from around the R Community. If you something to say on an R related topic, news, commentary, or an example of using R that you would like to share with the R Community, please email your ideas to <jonathan.regenstein@rstudio.com>.

Note that R Views is not the place to look for news or information on RStudio products or events. The widely syndicated blog at https://blog.rstudio.org will remain the place for RStudio open source and commercial product announcements, company events, and company news.

We welcome comments from all readers and encourage discussion. However, comments will not be moderated. Please be courteous and civil.

This blog is powered by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and [**blogdown**](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown). The theme was originally designed by [Ruipeng Zhang](http://github.com/ppoffice), ported to Hugo by [@digitalcraftsman](https://github.com/digitalcraftsman/hugo-icarus-theme), and [modified](https://github.com/yihui/hugo-icarus-theme) by Yihui Xie.
