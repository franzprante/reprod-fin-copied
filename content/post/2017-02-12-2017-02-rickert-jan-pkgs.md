by Joseph Rickert

As [forecast](https://www.rstudio.com/rviews/2017/01/06/10000-cran-packages/), the number of R packages hosted on CRAN exceed 10,000 in January. Dirk Eddelbuettel, who has been keeping track of what's happeining on CRAN with his [CRANberies](http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/cranberries/) site for a number of years, called [hurricaneexposure]() as the 10K package in a [tweet](https://twitter.com/eddelbuettel/status/825140310036578304) on January 27th. hurricaneexposure was of two hundred and six new packages that arrived on CRAN in January. I thought many of them were of high quality so picking out recommendations was unusually difficult this month. Here are my picks for the top fifty organized into xxx categories.
