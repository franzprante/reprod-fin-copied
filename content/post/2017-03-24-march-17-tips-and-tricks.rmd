This month's Tips and Tricks focus on file navigation. Many of these tips are straightforward - more tip than trick - but they can save quite a bit of time and frustration. 


### Open Recent

*Please* don't spend time navigating through your folder structure to find a recent project or file.

### Go to File/Function

RStudio automatically indexes all open files and files in the current project. The index includes function calls and objects within the files. To search the index, enter a search string in the `Go to file/function` window in the main toolbar or use the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl + .`. 

The search supports fuzzy matching as long as the search string is in the correct order. For example, `tiptric` will match files and function names like `march-tips-and-tricks.Rmd`.

### Find in File

In addition to the index, RStudio can quickly search the text of any file(s) for a string or regular expression. Open the `Find in Files` dialogue by navigating through the toolbar `Edit -> Find in Files` or using the keyboard shortcut `Cmd / Ctrl + Shift + F`.

### Tabs

**Close All and Close All Except Current**

If you're like me, you often end up with a whole bunch of files open and the number of tabs in the source pane causes anxiety. Don't click through the tabs closing each individually.

**Search for a Tab**

If you don't get anxiety from multiple tabs, you may find the keyboard shortcuts for switching between tabs helpful. My favorite is `Ctrl + Shift + .` which opens a search dialogue for the currently open tabs.

### Set Working Directory

Sometimes I find myself inside a file and I have no idea where that file is. In this scenario I often use the following trick to orient myself:

The other options, `To Project Directory` and `To File Pane Location` are also very helpful. These commands do not have keybindings by default, but you can create your own keyboard shortcuts for these actions: `Tools -> Modify Keyboard Shortcuts...`

### File Pane: Go To Working Directory

After mastering tip 5, you can easily navigate the file pane to the working directory:

### File Pane: Go To Project Root Directory

Finally, it is really easy to go to the root of a project directory:
