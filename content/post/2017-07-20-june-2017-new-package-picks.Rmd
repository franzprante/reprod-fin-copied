Two hundred and thirty-eight new packages were added to CRAN in June. Below are my picks for the "Top 40", organized into six categories: Biostatistics, Data, Machine Learning, Miscellaneous, Statistics and Utilities. Some packages, including `geofacet` and `secret`, already seem to be gaining traction.

### Biostatistics
