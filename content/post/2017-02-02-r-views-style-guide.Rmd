**Note to the Reader: The formatting in this early version of the document is primitive. It would be very nice if the formatting of this document becomes sufficiently polished to serve as a template for writing new posts. Please contribute your expertise.** 
   
# Introduction
This style guide is meant to be a comprehensive resource for authors who want to submit posts to the R Views blog. You will find sections describing the content and tone of the R Views blog, practical advice on formatting documents with R Markdown, pointers to external resources for grammatical resources and more.
# Guidelines for Authors

## Content
R Views is the RStudio blog devoted to the R Community and the R Language. We imagine it as a place to read considered opinion about topics of interest to the R Community. Topics could include:   
* The role of R in data science   
* The role of the R Community in fostering critical thinking and data driven decisions   
* The inner workings of the R language   
* Examples of R being used to explore problems in Statistics and Data Science   
* To learn about new R packages   
* To learn what is happening at conferences and user group meetings around the world   
* To see how RStudio tools can contribute to enhancing your R experience   

## A Typical Post
A typical post has about seven hundred and fifty words, two or three figures (images, pictures or plots) and some supporting R code. These are not hard and fast rules; the blogging medium permits a considerable amount of flexibility. However, we would like a typical R skilled R Viewers to be able to complete a first reading of a post in less than ten minutes. If you topic does not conform to these guidelines, consider delivering your work as a series of related posts.

## Submitting a Post
Authors submitting a post should follow one of the two workflows below. For now, authors who are not employees of RStudio must follow Workflow 1.

### WORKFLOW 1: The old-fashioned way for external authors
Prepare your post in an R Markdown file (.rmd) and send it to joseph.rickert@rstudio.com

### WORKFLOW 2: The collaborative way for RStudio authors
1. **Step1** - From your local RStudio IDE
    i)  Install blogdown
    ii) Make a local RStudio project that points to github/rstudio/rviews

2. **Step-2** - From github/rstudio/rviews
    i)  Make a branch for the new post
    ii)  Name branch: date author name and "slug" e.g., 2017-01_Regenstein_moreFinance

3. **Step-3** - From local repo:
    i)  Make a new file with title of post
    ii) use the blogdown command: `blogdown::new_post("title", rmd = TRUE)` or use the New Post Addin on the RStudio IDE
    iii) Put the content in the file
    iv)  Save the file
    v)  Pull
    vi)  Commit
    vii)  Push

4. **Step-4** - From github/rstudio/rviews
    i) Add joseph-rickert as reviewer
    ii) Do pull request, and assign to joseph-rickert
    iii) Notify JBR via email: joseph.rickert@rstudio.co

```
$\hat{\lambda}=1.02$ and $\alpha\sqrt{4}=2\alpha$      

Writing out a matrix
```
$$A_{m,n} =
 \begin{pmatrix}
  a_{1,1} & a_{1,2} & \cdots & a_{1,n} \\
  a_{2,1} & a_{2,2} & \cdots & a_{2,n} \\
  \vdots  & \vdots  & \ddots & \vdots  \\
  a_{m,1} & a_{m,2} & \cdots & a_{m,n}
 \end{pmatrix}$$
```  
$$A_{m,n} =
 \begin{pmatrix}
  a_{1,1} & a_{1,2} & \cdots & a_{1,n} \\
  a_{2,1} & a_{2,2} & \cdots & a_{2,n} \\
  \vdots  & \vdots  & \ddots & \vdots  \\
  a_{m,1} & a_{m,2} & \cdots & a_{m,n}
 \end{pmatrix}$$

Aligning equations    
[ref](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27081054/r-markdown-math-equation-allignment)
```
$$
\begin{aligned}
 AR(p): Y_i &= c + \epsilon_i + \phi_i Y_{i-1} \dots \\
 Y_{i} &= c + \phi_i Y_{i-1} \dots
\end{aligned}
$$
```
$$
\begin{aligned}
 AR(p): Y_i &= c + \epsilon_i + \phi_i Y_{i-1} \dots \\
 Y_{i} &= c + \phi_i Y_{i-1} \dots
\end{aligned}
$$
### Graphics
The following are three different methods for including a .png file in an R Markdown Document. The first method provides the most control.

Method 1    
```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=5,echo=TRUE}
# http://bit.ly/2kOSaw4
library(png)
library(grid)
img <- readPNG("./images/madrid_advert.png")
 grid.raster(img, x = unit(.55, "npc"))
```

Method 2    
```{r, out.width = "400px"}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/madrid_advert.png")
```
      
Method 3    
![](./images/madrid_advert.png)       

### Headers
```
# First Level Header   
## Second Level Header
### Third Level Header

I counted r `sum(c(1,2,3))` blue cars  
```
