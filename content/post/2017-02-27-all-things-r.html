Q&amp;A with: J.J. Allaire, Hadley Wickham &amp; Joe Cheng Moderator: Joseph Rickert</p>
<p><strong>Joseph Rickert</strong>: Well good afternoon, everyone. We’re very pleased to see you all here for the last session of the conference, and we’re so happy to have had you all attend during these past couple days. Basically, what we’re going to do now is have a question and answer session. I’m going to be the moderator. I have two questions that I would like to get out and, hopefully, they will give you some ideas about the range of things that you might want to ask about. We hope that the majority of the questions for this evening come from you in the audience.</p>
<p>All right, so I’m Joe Rickert and my panelists here need no introduction. My first question to the panel: What are you initial impressions of the past couple days? What happened here? Were there any surprises?</p>
<p><strong>J.J. Allaire</strong>: I would say my biggest impression is that we’ve come together as a group. The RStudio team has presented our philosophy about the sort of tools we think are good for data science and good for science too. It has always been our hope that we would find kindred spirits who share our beliefs and also want to use our tools. We would like our tools to influence people to say, “Yeah, I want to work that way. That’s how I think data analysis ought to be done.” It’s very gratifying to have all these kindred spirits who really do want to make data analysis great and work with the RStudio tool chain come together in one place.</p>
<p><strong>Joe Cheng</strong>: Whenever I’m working on software that requires some deep investment in thought and learning. my big worry is are people going to understand it, are they going to be interested enough to invest the time, and most of all, if they’re interested and they invest the time, are they actually going to be successful in understanding these concepts? This conference has been incredibly gratifying for me. The depth of insight that is apparent in the questions that I’ve been asked and the kinds of conversations I’ve had in between the sessions has been just a really huge confirmation that this community is really getting it.</p>
<p><strong>Hadley Wickham</strong>: So, to echo J.J. and Joe, like I think our metric of success is your success. And again, it’s just so great to see all of you like picking up these tools that we’re developing and using them to solve important problems and that’s fantastic.</p>
<p><strong>Joseph Rickert</strong>: My next question is going to take me a sentence or two to set up. I’ve been reading a book by the philosopher Owen Flanagan called “The Really Hard Problem”. In the book, Flanagan talks about finding meaning. How do you find meaning in a material world? He writes: “The evidence from history and philosophical anthropology leads to this picture of human nature. We are not born either fit or flourishing, but with thirst for both.” It strikes me that open source in general, and at R in particular is about both fitness and flourishing. So my question is: How do you see your work at RStudio with respect to these ideas, fitness and flourishing?</p>
<p><strong>J.J. Allaire</strong>: Eight years ago, when I finished my last software project, I knew one thing for certain, the next thing I worked on would be open source software. I felt that open source software is durable. It’s durable in that it’s not tied to a given corporate entity success or failure. It will outlive corporate entities even that sponsor them. And therefore, as an individual creator, it’s more rewarding to work on because I know it has this sort of opportunity to have this permanent lifetime. And I also think from a user’s view point, one of the most important things about R is that you know that your investment in it is actually not tied to any company and that your investment in it is durable. So, from the view point of finding meaning in work and feeling like your work is something that will have an impact over decades, there’s not much better that you can do than work on open source software.</p>
<p>Furthermore, for me, that the work that we all do is to try to understand the world as it is. That’s actually quite difficult. Every time you look deeply into a problem domain, you find that people thought they understood the world as it was and yet they didn’t. That’s probably the most important mission that we have as human beings is to understand the world as it is, and then we all have to decide what to do about it. For me, this company represents both working with data and understanding the world as it is and making durable contributions through open source software. It’s the best kind of place … the best job I could imagine.</p>
<p><strong>Joe Cheng</strong>: That’s a lot of philosophy for the last day of a conference, Joe. I feel like I could an awesome, really clever answer on Monday, but right now, I’m just staring blankly. No, when I heard that quote, I thought it was an eloquent expression of J.J.’s values. But, it also made me think of the fitness and flourishing of packages and of competing models of computation. Being at this conference has definitely made me think about the ideas that take hold in this community. What are the ideas that are pushed out despite their merits, what kind of fall by the wayside.</p>
<p>I do think its interesting for us as a community as we move forward to investigate what are the things that capture people’s imaginations. We have inklings of some answers, but then there are counterfactuals that make us wonder, “Well, why didn’t this succeed? Why didn’t this take off?”.</p>
<p><strong>Hadley Wickham</strong>: So I’m going to interpret the question a little bit differently again. because When I think kind of what is it that I enjoy doing, a big part of it is helping other people be successful. I really enjoy making packages that empower people to understand their data in ways that they couldn’t do before, but I also get a lot of personal satisfaction about taking an area or a subject or a set of tools that previously felt like a disconnected set of pieces that didn’t really fit together quite right and figuring out how to pull them apart into reusable components that can be recombined to solve problems.</p>
<p>One talk that I really enjoyed at this conference was Hillary’s about the analysis developer. As Hillary knows, this is a term that I have mixed feelings about, mainly because of the obvious abbreviation. One thing that Hillary brought up and Jenny paraphrased in the Tweet is like the role of restrictions, and how do restrictions and creativity play together? Sometimes I think if you have too much freedom, there are too many ways you can go wrong, and if you have too little freedom, you can’t do what you want. Just figuring out what is the right amount of freedom so that you can be optimally creative and do interesting things is a challenge.</p>
<p><strong>Joseph Rickert</strong>: Okay, I tried to lay out a range there of questions to stimulate thought. It’s up to you now. You can stay in the realm of philosophy or you can ask questions about who or what or why. So please, who’s first?</p>
<p><strong>Speaker from audience</strong>: Hi. Somewhat staying in the realm of philosophy - these past few days, we have seen all of these amazing things that can be done with R. So my question is: what are the limits to R? What things are there that at first might seem like they’re a good fit but actually aren’t?</p>
<p><strong>J.J. Allaire</strong>: Some eople might think of R as a programming language like Java, Python, and C++. If you view R this way then it has clear limits because it was actually not designed as a programming language per say. It was designed as a user interface to computation and visualization. At that task, it’s very, very good. ith the idea of making other domain specific languages out of it. Joe made this point in his talk, a lot of the philosophy of R comes from S which was developed to provide user interface to Fortran code. That is really what R is about is giving you a user interface to the best computing that’s available and the best statistical computations that’s available. I can’t think of a better one that’s out there now for doing the sort of work that we like to do.</p>
<p><strong>Joe Cheng</strong>: Maybe I can go before you give us the definitive word? So, let me expand on that a little bit and say that R about human factors, basically. It is a language in which you can create really concise, expressive descriptions of computation. This becomes interesting when we ask ourselves, well what did that trade off, right? In general, it’s easy to talk about what’s good, but it only becomes interesting when you talk about what did we leave behind in order to make that possible? I think it’s actually really instructive to compare R to two particular languages, Python and Go.</p>
<p>Python was designed, among other things, for being predictable so that it’s easy to read. If you’ve read one piece of Python code, so the thinking goes, you’ve read them all. And so the end result is kind of very boring code, and I don’t say that as a pejorative, well I mean, I do, but Pythonistas would take that as a compliment because boring means you’re not going to be surprised by cleverness. And I think with R, it makes it possible to be very clever, and I take that as a compliment and I think a Pythonista would say that that’s a pejorative. And we’re both right, I mean, we’re both wrong, it really depends on what you value and what your organization or what your project is going for.</p>
<p>I think that’s one end of the spectrum where we go for predictability versus expressiveness. And clearly with things like dplyr and Shiny, we take full advantage of the language features of R that really hamstring predictable reading and hamstring performance, but they are really beautiful ways to express these kinds of computations. The desire to be able to have a really flexible interface language also impacts performance. AndGo is an example of a language that is both kind of boring in its syntax and goes to great lengths to make sure that you can’t do things that wil greatly inhibit performance, other than maybe having a garbage collector.</p>
<p><strong>Hadley Wickham</strong>: So to me, R is an unparalleled environment for exploration of in memory data. And in some sense, there’s no way that R is ever going to be good at exploring out of memory data. But there’s not actually a problem because the neat thing about R is this, that you can create these languages inside of R. The original vision of John Chambers was R as this interface language. R doesn’t have to do everything, it just needs to be able to talk to the right people, needs to be able to talk to the right other specialized environments for large data and other specialized things. What’s great about R to me is that you can develop these very flexible work flows. You can iterate quickly on data that fits in memory and then, you can talk within R, you can talk to other systems which can handle much, much larger data sets because they have made very different trade offs with respect to performance and expressiveness.</p>
<p><strong>New speaker from audience</strong>: When people talk about languages, they discuss the lifetime of the language, whe its going to die, or fade, or things like that. Where do you see R now, and how do you see it in the next few years?</p>
<p><strong>J.J. Allaire</strong>: I don’t think that’s knowable. But one thing noteworthy about R that could lend credence to the idea that it’s going to grow a lot or that it’s going to plateau is that it’s a 40 year old language, and it’s still gaining in use and relevance. That’s exceptional. There’s not a lot of 40 year old languages that are still gaining in their application and use. And so, we don’t know, but I think we see a lot of promise, especially in the way that it’s possible for people who are not from a conventional software engineering background to become successful with R. R has a lot of growth in front of it still, but obviously ther is work to do to make it even more and more approachable. Aside from that, I don’t have a prediction.</p>
<p><strong>Hadley Wickham</strong>: I think R is a little different because it is almost like this language for constructing other miniature languages. I think it’s unusual in that we’re still learning how to like write good R code. We’re still exploring just because the space of the language is much, much bigger than other programming languages. That’s why we’re seeing these changes in the way that people write R code. We’re still trying to figure out what is the best way to use R. R isn’t even middle aged to me. It’s still like a teenager experimenting.</p>
<p>So I think there’s a long way to go. People sometimes try to make out there’s a war between R and Python or and R and other languages. That’s not true, but suppose its true that now that 50% of people are using R and 50% of people are using Python for data analysis. In 10 years time, even if only 10% of the people doing data analysis are using R there will still be many people using R because many more people will be using a programming language to do data analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Joe Cheng</strong>: When you asked that question thoughts about user numbers, growth numbers, RStudio download numbers immediately popped into my head. But the more I think about it the really meaningful and more important metric is how healthy is the community and how diverse is the talent that’s coming into it. The innovation that we see in the community, that’s really the most encouraging thing. Also, the adopting of best practices, the growing up that I feel is happening throughout the package ecosystem is the most encouraging sign that R is still on the way up.</p>
<p><strong>Joseph Rickert</strong>(directed to the audience): Thank you, so how about what are you all thinking? So what would you like to be able to do in R that you can’t do now? How about questions along those lines? What do you really need? What sets your hair on fire? Why do you stay up at night?</p>
<p><strong>New speaker from audience</strong>: I work in an institute of about 200 cancer researchers: 20 use R, and 180 use Excel. What can we do to help those 180 people use a more appropriate data analysis paradigm?</p>
<p><strong>Joe Cheng</strong>: So you’re saying you’d like R to cure cancer?</p>
<p><strong>Hadley Wickham</strong>: I think the question was actually about a much harder challenge: how do we stop people from using Excel? I think you need the carrot and the stick. You need to show people like, “Hey, you’re doing this stuff in Excel, and you have very limited ability to automate. You’re doing the same thing again and again and again. Like that weekly report you’re putting together that involves you copying and pasting from 16 different spreadsheets into 18 other spreadsheets like, that’s painful and you can make your life much more pleasant by learning a bit of code and automating that.” That’s kind of the carrot and the stick is like, “Hey, I’m going to look back at some of those spreadsheets, and I’m going to show you all of the mistakes you’ve made?</p>
<p>Using Excel is incredibly error prone and you have very little provenance. You can’t track how what manipulations users do to data. But I think it’s the carrot that’s more important. People generally change because they’re lazy. Activating people’s like laziness is a very effective, persuasive technique.</p>
<p><strong>J.J. Allaire</strong>: To echo that: it is much more difficult obviously, to get started with R than it is to get started with Excel. I think that later in the workflow, it’s much easier to use R than Excel. But to get started with Excel, you just start typing in some cells and you’re done. With R, it’s like, “Oh, it’s a programming language.”&quot; So you have to motivate, you have to give activation energy to get people through a pretty harsh initial curve, no matter how good we make it. What we try to do is say: “Look at the outcome that you will get if you learn Shiny, if you learn rmarkdown, if you use these tools for doing modeling. One part is providing the motivation and the other part is then providing ramps, the educational experiences that allow them to take that motivation and translate it into success.</p>
<p>Even with that, even if we do all that really well maybe the best we can do is get to 60 of the 180. It is going to take a lot of effort and motivation and Excel plays to easy answers, it plays to where a lot of us are psychologically: What’s the least thing I can do to get things done. So I think we want to start a bonfire that’s basically creates this big motivator. We’re not going to get them all there, but hopefully we can get many more than we have now.</p>
<p><strong>Joe Cheng</strong>: As I was getting ready for my talks, I watched some of the talks from useR! for inspiration. Jenny Bryan made the really good point that Excel users are people: “Some of my best friends use Excel, you know”. It’s so easy for those of us have already ascended the mountain, gained the learning curve and are now reaping the benefits to feel like, “Why aren’t you all doing this”. But, if we don’t have empathy and recognize that there are very good reasons why they are stuck in their patterns they are, if we are just self righteously beating people over the head to use R, then we’re no better than Emacs users.</p>
<p><strong>Hadley Wickham</strong>: One last thing I want to add is to normalize the process of learning R: You are absolutely going to be frustrated. I spend my life programming in R basically, and at points, I am still so frustrated that I’m literally banging my head against the desk, and I know it’s not going to be easy, but the payoff’s worth it. Everyone experiences frustration. It’s not just you, and it definitely gets less over time. I think it’s really important to normalize that experience.</p>
<p><strong>Joseph Rickert</strong> (directed to the audience: Do we have another question?</p>
<p><strong>New speaker from the audience</strong>: So I guess on the flip side to Excel, a lot of newer colleagues are working in Python, some other languages because of the deep learning frameworks that have been built there and the data structures for images and video that R is really not yet well prepared to ingest. Do you see that as something that we’ll be trying to build interfaces for, or is it something that we’ll like leave to the software engineers?</p>
<p><strong>J.J. Allaire</strong>: No, I think it’s very important that R do well at deep learning, and I thin a focus we have for this year is to build bridges to some of the best deep learning libraries from R. One in particular is Google’s TensorFlow. It’s actually way more than a deep learning library, it’s a machine learning library that has strong deep learning application. But actually, the most popular libraries for doing deep learning are from Python and they are really set apart because of their expressiveness. They really are going for that, and so I’m hopeful that we can tie R’s expressiveness with all the other great things in R. R’s great data visualizations, Shiny, R Markdown etc. I think we can take a lot of the best of that and make R a really terrific environment for deep learning but it will take an explicit effort.</p>
<p>I think most of the people who have traditionally been involved in deep learning are computer scientists. That is where that came from. It did not principally come from statisticians, although it’s becoming increasingly relevant in various domains of data analysis and now you’re starting to see people from the world of data analysis and statisticians coming into it. So, I think it’s understandable why the lineage is with Python, but we would like to make R a wonderful environment to do that, and that’s a near-term focus.</p>
<p><strong>New speaker from the audience</strong>: One thing that seems to be been gaining momentum in the Python and JavaScript spaces are better code introspection tools which at least increase the probability of things not going wrong in production environments. So you optional typing or even strongly typed languages like TypeScript wrapping things. What attempts are ongoing to make R something that we can feel more confident about in a collaborative setting? For example, maybe I just see the function signature, but I’m confident how the function is going to behave or I’m confident that putting this in a production environment and it’s not going to throw up on me. Have you been making forays into that space or are thinking about it?</p>
<p><strong>Joe Cheng</strong>: I can say something specifically from the Shiny side of the world because I think that’s where at least a lot of the people we talk to are running into these kinds of problems. Before we even get to syntax changes like strong typing, I mean there is just basic hygiene that’s not being followed right now. We have customers that go from hacking away on data science stuff to production level apps on the same box without even packrat and are surprised when things go wrong. I mean, there is such a long road to hoe in terms of user education, and I think in the JavaScript and Python communities, the people who are working on those projects come from software engineering backgrounds or from operations backgrounds and they already know the processes. In my experience, to a large extent, it’s the data scientists who are trying to be admins on a Linux box for the first who running into these kinds of problems.</p>
<p>So first we have maybe a culture problem, secondly, even in terms of technology, there’s a lot more that we could be doing I think. I talked about how Shiny is gaining practical testing tools for this next version. And yes, I think strong typing and all sorts of really interesting CS stuff to make R a better language, but that’s very far away right now on the cost benefit analysis scale than other things that we have identified..</p>
<p><strong>Hadley Wickham</strong>: The first step is just explicitly recognizing that R is not just a programming language, it’s also an environment for doing interactive data analysis, and some things that work really well in one situation, don’t work so well in the other. Part of it is just education, like learning what work’s relevant to data analysis because you want to move quickly. If you get the wrong result, you’ll quickly see what the problem is. When you move into production you want to be more explicit and have things fail more clearly. Just getting the mindset that he code I write to do a quick analysis or exploration is going to have to be different from the code that’s going to run every day for the next year: if it fails, it’s going to fail really clear.</p>
<p>We just have to recognize that there’s two styles or two ways of thinking about R code. I think we’re starting to see more tools as more people put more R code into production. Tony Frschetti has a great package called <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/assertr/index.html">assertr</a> that’s basically run-time testing for data analysis pipelines. I think that we’re going to see more and more people asking what does it mean to take the software best practices from software engineering and port to data analysis?</p>
<p><strong>New speaker from the audience</strong>: Earlier, we were talking about diversity and innovation. I am a relatively new R user. I haven’t heard anyone make fun of SPSS yet, but I was a point-and-click SPSS user bangging my head against the wall. As a user, I look around at my colleagues and friends and wish that more people used R. But I hear a lot, especially from women in the social sciences, that they’re inherently intimidated, even if they’re like brilliant scientists. So what do you guys, sitting up on the stage, envision as your role in increasing women as R users and creators of packages, and then what would you suggest that we as users in the community can do to empower others so that we can continue to be innovative in R and have a long life of R.</p>
<p>Joseph Rickert: I sit on the <a href="https://www.r-consortium.org/">R Consortium</a> for RStudio. The R Consortium is an industry backed project, organized under the Linux Foundation, to develop infrastructure to support R and the R Community. The companies in the Consortium have extended idea of what infrastructure means to include not only software, but the kinds of things that you’re talking about. There are several initiatives, an R user group support program for one, that encourages the growth of R user groups around the world as safe places where you can go and meet people face-to-face and learn in a non-intimidating environment. There is even a whole international network now of <a href="https://rladies.org/">R-Ladies</a> user groups that have been explicitly formed to recognize this need.</p>
<p>The R Consortium is trying to figure out how to expand diversity activities which include conferences like this one and <a href="http://satrdays.org/">satRdays</a>. The R Consortium is the place for you to express your ideas. We would like to work with people who could provide immediate, local solutions to these kinds of problems if they had a little bit of funding. I’d be very happy to talk with you about these things.</p>
<p><strong>Hadley Wickham</strong>: I absolutely believe that it’s our responsibility. This is something we thought a lot about at the conference and certainly we’re going to do better in future years. Its unfortunate that we’re ending the conference with a panel of white… well mostly white…sorry Joe… males. You know, I think we need to do better at embracing all sorts of diversity. I mean, we had a small diversity scholarship program for this conference, we really tried to make sure we got a range of speakers and that’s something that we believe that’s very important. And we want to make sure that we can have panels like this where we’re not just inviting people up because they look different to us, but because everyone, people from all sorts of backgrounds are making great contributions to R. I think it’s really hard to figure out what the next steps are, what are concrete actions we can take. So we are very happy to hear any suggestions, and we’re going to keep working really hard at this as well.</p>
<p><strong>Joe Cheng</strong>: <em>(Ed note - What is the conference name mentioned below?)</em> I mean, I sort of hesitate a little to even answer this question being an American man sitting up … oh, sorry Hadley … but in all seriousness, I obviously can only see this problem from the outside in, but I’ve really been encouraged by a lot of the initiatives that these guys have talked about. Another conference that really deserves a shout out is [inaudible 00:36:51] and he works harder than any conference I’ve ever seen to make sure that not just gender diversity and international diversity, but diversity in terms of experience and domains and things like that. And I have to admit, the first time I attended one of his conferences saw how much effort he put into it, I thought, “This might be a little over the top,” but what an incredibly … just an incredibly interestingly diverse … I can’t even explain the kind of conversations that happened in that conference that I don’t see anywhere else. Also, I have never been to an R-Ladies meet up because, but from my understanding, I’ve heard such wonderful things about them.</p>
<p>In our cummunity, while we still obviously have a lot to do, there are pockets of success stories that we can point to when in so much of the tech industry today, it seems like it’s just like a dystopia, and there even an argument as to whether there is even a problem. At least we seem to be making positive steps in the right direction, but certainly, we as conference organizers and people who are very active in this community are more than open to your suggestions, especially for those of you who have been at this conference and have specific concrete suggestions about next year, we are absolutely all ears.</p>
<p><strong>New speaker from the audience</strong>: I know R is single threaded. It was the way it was designed. The parallel packages as a source of contempt sometimes for me sometimes: errors, et cetera. I’m just curious about how you guys are visualizing going into bigger data and parallelization and R support for that.</p>
<p><strong>J.J. Allaire</strong>: I’ll let Joe answer about the parallel package, but there’s two types of parallelism. There’s parallelism on my machine taking advantage of the my hardware, and there’s distributed computing. We’ve talked a lot about distributed processing with <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sparklyr/index.html">sparklyr</a>. I won’t get into that, but it’s something we are doing. In terms of local parallelization, there is quite a bit to do. Joe, I think that’s on your radar?</p>
<p><strong>Joe Cheng</strong>: I probably don’t know enough about this yet to even answer confidently, but I do want to say a couple things that I think are needed in this space. So before we even get into individual limitations of how we do things in parallel, I do think that the first step is to agree on the API, not only parallel, but asynchronous programming. Your comment on cross platform is really interesting. And I’ll just say this, I’m guessing you’re a Windows user?</p>
<p><strong>Same speaker from the audience</strong>: I switch. That’s part of my problem.</p>
<p><strong>Joe Cheng</strong>: You know, it’s not … I haven’t used the parallel package a lot, but the inherent tools that the operating system gives you are so very different between Windows and POSIX operating systems. It’s really easy for people in the POSIX world to just fork, do something, and then just collect. To try to do the same thing in Windows requires a whole different way of thinking. So, to the extent that people try and make those things look the same, they either short change the POSIX side of things, or if they let POSIX be what POSIX wants to be, thenthey have to do something completely different and often much slower for Windows. So it is an inherently, technically, difficult problem, but it is certainly one that we’re going to be thinking about.</p>
<p><strong>New speaker from the audience</strong>: How do you see the migration from the safe cocoon of CRAN into GitHub for the community and for maintaining what is good and bad and everything.</p>
<p><strong>Hadley Wickham</strong>: I believe that at least sort of 50% of the value of having a package on CRAN is that it indicate that the author of that package was willing to jump through some hoops. Some of those hoops are really important, and some of those hoops are completely unimportant, but it does say that someone is dedicated enough to push it through. I think it’s just a really good kind of flag. I hope that people see that CRAN as the home of packages for R. GitHub is fantastic, it’s great for experimentation, it’s great for development, but CRAN is still like the gold standard just because there is that little extra barrier. It’s not necessarily meaningful, but it signals that the author is willing to do some work and really cares about the code.</p>
<p><strong>J.J. Allaire</strong>: CRAN has this policy of submitting every 30 days. Sometimes annoying to package developers, but I can tell you as a person whose maintained many packages it makes me think carefully about submitting to CRAN. If I think there’s a risk of regression, I’ll take another month for testing because I know that I can’t resubmit. So you might experience them as personal inconveniences, but some of the barriers that are put up indicate effort. They guarantee a level of quality. I think that works well. Having GitHub means that lots of things can flourish and lots of things don’t have to go over that bar. It is a distinguishing characteristic of R compared to other programming language ecosystems where you can just like register yourself into a repository. And even the fact that CRAN runs tests recursively against everything, against everything means that generally speaking, things will work well together.</p>
<p><strong>Hadley Wickham</strong>: Yes, I think part of the benefit of CRAN is that it pushes pain away from the users onto the developers. And as a developer, that can be really, really painful sometimes, but we suffer so you don’t have to.</p>
<p><strong>New speaker from the audience</strong>: You know we’ve heard some talk and I’m going to say a theme even, about tidy data that you are also adding <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/caret/index.html">caret</a> to your repertoire. I’m wondering if you could talk a little bit about some five year goals, where do you think that company is going to be in five years, besides the obvious answer of making a cheat sheet for caret.</p>
<p><strong>J.J. Allaire</strong>: I’ll say one thing about one of the ways that we approach product development: we actually don’t have roadmaps on purpose because we actually like to be very fluid in how we approach what problems we solve, and when. So, if we printed here’s the three year roadmap for what we’re doing, in six months, we’d be changing our mind on a third of it. The vectors that we have been investing in, like everything that you heard about the tidyverse, are all of the efforts to educate people and help people communicate with R through Shiny and rmarkdown, helping enterprises and large organizations adopt R scale.</p>
<p>Those things are the core streams that you’ll see elaborated upon. Within that when you have a roadmap with specifics your are constrained. Remember the year of <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggvis/index.html">ggvis</a>? I’ll let these guys say their piece too, but those are the big themes. Then within that, we try to be pretty fluid about what we focus on in the next six months or twelve months.</p>
<p><strong>Hadley Wickham</strong>: Yes, my policy is never to declare a year of anything ever again.</p>
<p><strong>Joe Cheng</strong>: Similarly, you know with Shiny: I can see three months into the future, that’s about it. But I will say one thing: our first products were RStudio, rmarkdown, Shiny, we brought Hadley on, everything that we were doing was for everyone. We were trying to hit the entire R world with everything that we did. And that was really great, but then from talking with people I was noticed that there was always that one piece of their workflow that they cannot live without that was awful. Maybe not awful, but just it didn’t necessarily work fluidly the way that we want things to work.</p>
<p>And so I was wondering, are we working so hard just to make sure that everybody has an 80% good experience and will we ever work on making sure that some niche, some verticals get 100% good experience. And my first and only foray into this was working on Leaflet for spatial mapping. It turns out it’s really hard to get things to 100%. It turns out that even if you carve off one chunk of one bit of one niche that there are a lot of hard problems, but I would like to see if we get to the point where we feel like we’ve got this great foundation now for everyone. Are we a company of the size and the resources that we can dedicate teams and projects towards going after much more specific things that we could do today and have end-to-end stories that are just incredibly thought through and well done? I’d be interested to see if and when it happens.</p>
<p><strong>J.J. Allaire</strong>: I would like to see is that we set examples, create tools, and create an environment in which you can build specifics. right? It’s unbelievable, the diversity of things people do. It would be great to solve spatial, but then what about the next 98 things? I think that one of the reasons that Hadley has historically put so much into like package development tooling and education about package development is to teach other people how to build the kind of tools that we build. I think that will be a big focus for us in the next couple years because I think that 75% of the packages in the tidyverse ought to be ones not written by RStudio. That’s really the idea. We need to do more with tooling and education to help level everyone up to be able to write those kinds of packages. That’s the goal.</p>
<p><strong>New speaker from the audience</strong>: At this conference, we focused a lot on the science of data science, reproducible research, reactivity, the tidyverse. But actually in my day to day job, the hardest part, which is also the most rewarding and the most creative, is really putting all those concepts together and creating analyses or apps that try to solve all the world’s problems. But where I get stuck sometimes is kind of in this creative sphere. I’ve got the tools, I’m empowered, with what all of you guys do, but what about linking it to the creativity side? I was wondering maybe in the future if you have plans to kind of working that creativity domain more?</p>
<p><strong>Hadley Wickham</strong>: Yes, things like communication and persuasion are really, really, really hard and outside of the domain of what we do: build software tools, but that’s it. It seems to me that bringing in more people who can talk at that level of things, maybe not even necessarily about R, would be a great thing to do at this conference next year.</p>
<p><strong>Joe Cheng</strong>: If I understand your question correctly then it might be a hackathon or something like that might be an even better sort of venue to stimulate those kinds of thoughts than this kind of a conference setting, but I agree that sounds great.</p>
<p><strong>New speaker from the audience</strong> Along with writing a bunch of random packages and doing cyber security, I also teach data science at the community college level, and I work with a lot of students. What I see there’s a big movement away from laptops, Desktops are dead, laptops are a thing of the past. Mobile devices, especially iPads or Android based devices are the big thing. I’ve actually seen people demonstrate to me they can do a data analysis workflow, and I’m going to use some bad language, sorry, with Excel and Tableau on those platforms and communicate results effectively. Are there any plans to make a better iOS and Android experience? Give us some way to do that.</p>
<p><strong>J.J. Allaire</strong>: We believe pretty strongly that even though using tools like Tableau and Excel that you can stick into a mobile user interface can be expeditious and straightforward and even effective in some cases, that if you learn how to write code for data analysis, you will have much better outcomes along many vectors. We’re all in on that and we’re going to make that as good as we can make it. And make it as great a neighborhood to live in as it can be, and hope that people come and join us there. I think that mobile and touch mobile devices are a terrible place to write code. I believe in a keyboard and a screen that’s at least 13 inches. No, we have no plans for mobile.</p>
<p><strong>Hadley Wickham</strong>: So part of it is are you using a point and click GUI or are you writing code? J.J.’s pretty convincingly answered that. The other part of it is are you doing the computing on your resources or some resources in the cloud, and I think it just seems almost inevitable that you will have to be in the cloud because that’s just where everything is moving.</p>
<p><strong>New speaker from the audience</strong>: A book that came out recently, Cathy O’Neil’s “Weapons of Math Destructionan” is&quot; incredible read. I hope everyone’s had a chance to see it. We were talking earlier about opinionated analysis; getting at the idea of embedding our values into how we write code and those kinds of things. I’m wondering, just as you’re thinking about code being collaborative so that people can read it and contribute, what are you thinking in terms the ethics behind data science: what role R, the community, the language, the environment might play in both the kinds of things people are doing with these tools and how you’re steering people towards non-evil outcomes?</p>
<p><strong>J.J. Allaire</strong>: I think one of the things we can do is make sure that work is inspectable and reproducible. That’s the main thing, that work is transparent. In terms of the ethics that someone brings to data analysis … that’s a terribly difficult problem. I don’t think any of us would go for this, but Edward Tufte gave a talk where he said pharmaceutical companies were going to do a study where they pre-specified all of the analysis methods before they collected data so that they couldn’t do any p hacking.</p>
<p>I guess that does eliminate some of the problem, but it also takes away the full range of methods that you’d like to use to get at the truth. So, that is an ethical problem, it’s also it’s a problem of education. I think for us, just promoting a workflow that’s inspectable and reproducible might be the limit of what we can do, but you guys might have more …</p>
<p><strong>Hadley Wickham</strong>: Yes, I think like reproducibility is obviously the key to ethical data analysis. But, there’s another dimension of ethics: what if someone is using R and RStudio to figure out the best place to put a bomb? I don’t think we can control that, in some sense, the counterbalance of open source software is all about not restricting your freedom to do like bad things with the code. We have to accept it as a cost. Whenever you restrict someone’s behavior so they can’t do something bad, you’re also restricting their behavior so they can’t do something that’s good as well. To me, that’s one of the challenges of open source software and freedom of speech.</p>
<p>It’s just a very, very difficult line to walk. We want to make sure that code is clear, that you can do reproducible research, and you can understand other people’s code so that you can verify if it seems ethical to you. But we’re just not in a position to impose our ethics onto others.</p>
<p><strong>New speaker from the audience</strong>: I think Joe’s original question a while back was what annoys you about R and what do you want fixing? There are a few functions in base R for which I don’t think have a great replacements at the moment. For example, the print method for environments are terrible, are there any base R functions that really annoy you and you want to fix?</p>
<p><strong>Hadley Wickham</strong>: Most of the ones that really annoy me, I’ve already fixed in some form. I think we’re continuing to do that. Over time, we will be carving off more things.</p>
<p>I guess the number one thing that annoys me in base R right now that I don’t have a good replacement for is all like the file operations. There’s stuff like that and the fact that sometimes some of the file operations fail silently and that leaves me scratching my head. That’s probably the thing that like annoys me most on the day to day basis.</p>
<p><strong>J.J. Allaire</strong>: I think we need 64-bit integers in R. I don’t know what the roadmap for that is. That’s one big thing, and the other thing we need is we need out of memory vectors.</p>
<p><strong>Hadley Wickham</strong>: I don’t think 64-bit integers are ever going to happen. That’s my considered opinion and I’m looking for better work arounds. I think the bit 64 package is the best right now.</p>
<p><strong>Joe Cheng</strong>: I would like a pony if we’re … I don’t do data analysis mostly, but I tend to not be bothered by things in base R. I guess I’ve worked in a lot of computing environments and R is pretty amazing compared to some of them. The only one thing that I deeply wish could be different, although I understand why it is the way it is, is the partial matching on dollar sign. I hope that’s not news to some of you here, but if you retrieve an attribute and don’t use exact equals true, then it’ll do partial name matching. It’s that kind of stuff that might work fine 99% of the time until it doesn’t.</p>
<p>Hadley Wickham: While we’re waiting for the question, I just wanted to remind everyone, please fill out the RStudio conference survey. We hope that this conference has been great, but we want to make next year’s even better so please let us know what we succeeded at, and where we could do better, we’d really appreciate that, thank you.</p>
<p>** New speaker from the audience**: I’m going to try to be quick about this since I think we’re a little bit over time, I’m harking back a bit to two questions ago when we were talking about values in data science, and it occurs to me that there are ethical values, but there are also epistemic values. And I can’t help thinking that the way that we do data science is shaping our notion of what constitutes science and my gut feeling is that it leads us o value pragmatics in much the same way that say behaviorist psychology values pragmatics as a primary idea of what science ought to do for us, right? Does this model let us predict stuff, forget how the match actually works or whether it reflects reality.</p>
<p>And in the same way, it strikes me that the way we currently do data science tends us towards anti-realism in the same way that say, quantum theory tended to be in the early twentieth century, anti-realistic in the sense that we don’t care whether our models are reflecting the genuine operation of causally efficacious variables, we just care again that we get somewhere. I wonder if you have anything to say about the way that … returning again to grand theory … the way that you think that R is shaping the notion of science in the twenty-first century in terms of what science ought to be.</p>
<p><strong>Hadley Wickham</strong>: Well, I’d like to say first, thanks for ending with a really simple question. That’s such a big question, I don’t really know. I mean personally, I am just so driven by pragmatics and I think Joe and J.J. are too. I don’t want to put words in their mouths, but to me, I kind really care what is reality. I care does this help you kind of solve the problem you have right now. In that sense, I think your analysis is pretty spot on.</p>
<p><strong>Joe Cheng</strong>: I don’t know, I’d say I’m primarily driven by epistemology when I code. That’s why I’d like to break my answer into 16 parts. No, I have no idea …really I’m just trying to smash JavaScript and R together.</p>
<p><strong>J.J. Allaire</strong>: I think there is one role that R has to play, I think you have modeling for prediction and modeling for understanding. A lot of the modeling purely for prediction that you see is done in a way that’s very naïve about the principles of statistics. I see some of that coming form a more computer science oriented culture saying, “Well, we want to predict this, you know, we’re working in ad tech and we want to predict this thing, that’s all we care about.” I think people who’ve studied statistics for a long time have been educated about the nuances of applying statistical methods are better equipped to understand the difference between prediction and understanding. The R community comes more from the statistical tradition so I think we have a strong role to play in ensuring that people involved in data science don’t lose sight of the fact that prediction is not tantamount to understanding and not all that it takes to achieve understanding.</p>
<p><strong>Joe Cheng</strong>: I’d like to say that it may be true that the tools of data science are affecting our values and understanding, but I think more than that, it’s the results of data science, right? It is the kinds of results that we’re getting from machine learning that’s causing us to value and do more machine learning. That’s really impacting our lives.</p>
<p>Google translate is this perfect battleground. Human language translation, natural language translation is this battleground between linguistics on one side and machine learning on the other and we all use Google translate now because it actually works. I think being focused on the pragmatics is going to shift the things that we value, but if we’re shifting them because those are the things that are improving the lives of people around us then …</p>
<p><strong>J.J. Allaire</strong>: Well, thank you everyone and have a safe trip home. We hope to see you again next year.</p>
