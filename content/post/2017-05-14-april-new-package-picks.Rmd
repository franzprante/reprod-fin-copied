Here are my picks for the "Top 40" new packages submitted to CRAN in April 2017. These selections, which were culled from 208 submissions, are organized into four categories: Data, Finance, Statistics and Utilities. The number of entries in the Data and Utilities categories reflect the initiatives of R developers to connect to external resources.
