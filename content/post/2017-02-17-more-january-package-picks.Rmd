by Joseph Rickert

In a [recent post](https://www.rstudio.com/rviews/2017/02/17/january-new-data-packages/), I highlighted several new packages that arrived on CRAN in January that provided R users with access to data. In this post, I present additional selections for interesting January packages, organized into the categories Miscellaneous, Machine Learning, Statistics and Utilities.

## Miscellaneous
* [rcss](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/rcss/) v1.2: Provides functions for [Solving Control Problems with Linear State Dynamics](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/rcss/vignettes/Practical_User_Guide.pdf).

* [stormwindmodel](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/stormwindmodel/) v0.1.0: Provides functions to calculate wind speeds for hurricanes and tropical storms in the North American Atlantic basin. One [vignette](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/stormwindmodel/vignettes/Details.html) describes the package and [another](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/stormwindmodel/vignettes/Overview.html) shows how to use it.


## Machine Learning
* [crisp](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/crisp/) v1.0.0: Implements the convex regression with interpretable partitions ([CRISP](http://jmlr.org/papers/volume17/15-344/15-344.pdf)) method of predicting an outcome variable on the basis of two covariates.

* [fst](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/fst/) v0.7.2: Provides functions to read and write data frames at high speed, and compress data with type-optimized algorithms that allow random access of stored data frames.
