I am ever-optimistic that on the weekend I will have enough time and brainpower to do some serious technical reading. The following are five articles on my list. I hope that at least one of them resonates with you too. Happy reading.

1. In this [paper from Nature Communications](http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms12474), Kun-Hsing Yu et al. use machine learning to diagnose cancer. The authors write:

    > “We extract 9,879 quantitative image features and use regularized machine-learning methods to select the top features and to distinguish shorter-term survivors from longer-term survivors with stage I adenocarcinoma (P&lt;0.003) or squamous cell carcinoma (P=0.023) in the TCGA data set.”

    Figure **a** shows ROC curves for classifying lung [adenocarcinoma](http://www.cancercenter.com/terms/adenocarcinoma/) versus adjacent normal tissue.

2. John Mount and Nina Zumel describe [Why you should re-encode high dimensional categorical variables.](http://www.win-vector.com/blog/2016/11/you-should-re-encode-high-cardinality-categorical-variables/)

3. Jamie Ashander delves into the details of the [statistics of General Linear Mixed Models](http://www.ashander.info/posts/2015/04/D-RUG-mixed-effects-viz/?utm_content=buffer9fd4c&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer), and provides the R code to help you build your own models.

4. Sebastian Ruder does a fine job of explaining the math in his post [An overview of gradient descent optimization algorithms](http://sebastianruder.com/optimizing-gradient-descent/index.html#nesterovacceleratedgradient)

5. Iwana and Uchida use deep learning to do something your mother told you never to do: [Judging a Book by Its Cover](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.09204v1.pdf)
