## WORKFLOW 1: The old-fashioned way for external authors
Prepare your post in an R Markdown file (.rmd) and send it to joseph.rickert@rstudio.com

## WORKFLOW 2: The collaborative way for RStudio authors
All of the steps in this workflow need to be carried out. Note that the tasks in some steps are done in the local repo and others are done on the R Views Gitbub page
1. **Step1** - From your local RStudio IDE
    i)  Install blogdown
    ii) Make a local RStudio project that points to github/rstudio/rviews

2. **Step-2** - From github/rstudio/rviews
    i)  Make a branch for the new post
    ii)  Name branch: date author name and "slug" e.g., 2017-01_Regenstein_moreFinance

3. **Step-3** - From local repo:
    i)  Make a new file with title of post
    ii) use the blogdown command: `blogdown::new_post("title", rmd = TRUE)` or use the New Post Addin on the RStudio IDE
    iii) Put the content in the file
    iv)  Save the file
    v)  Pull
    vi)  Commit
    vii)  Push

4. **Step-4** - From github/rstudio/rviews
    i) Add joseph-rickert as reviewer
    ii) Do pull request, and assign to joseph-rickert
    iii) Notify JBR via email: joseph.rickert@rstudio.co
