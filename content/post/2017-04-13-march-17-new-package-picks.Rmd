Two hundred and sixteen new packages were added to CRAN in March. The following are my picks for the *Top Forty*, organized into five categories: Bioscience, Data, Data Science, Statistics and Utilities.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
# packages required for this post
for (pkg in c('Polychrome','treespace')) 
  if (!requireNamespace(pkg)) install.packages(pkg)
```
